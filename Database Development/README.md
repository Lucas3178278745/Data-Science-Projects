# Animal_Shelter

In our project, we focused on designing and implementing data pipelines within a relational database system (RDBMS) to revolutionize how animal shelter information was recorded and accessed. The objective was to automate and streamline the data management process, making it both efficient and scalable.

At the outset, we encountered the challenge of integrating diverse data sources, including adoption records, medical histories, and inventory management, all of which were crucial for the comprehensive management of the shelter. To address this, we meticulously designed our data pipelines to ensure seamless data ingestion from these varied sources. By employing SQL transactions, we facilitated the consistent and reliable entry of data, effectively reducing manual data entry errors and enhancing the integrity of our database.

Moreover, we implemented automated triggers and stored procedures within our RDBMS. These elements were key to automating routine tasks, such as updating the inventory of supplies as adoptions occurred or scheduling regular medical check-ups for the animals in care. This automation not only saved valuable staff time but also ensured that critical tasks were performed with accuracy and timeliness.

To further optimize the process of recording and accessing information, we developed a user-friendly interface that allowed shelter staff to easily enter, retrieve, and analyze data. This interface was directly connected to our backend database system, ensuring real-time data updates and access. Features such as advanced search capabilities and customizable reports were introduced to meet the specific needs of the shelter, allowing for quick access to information on animal availability, medical records, and adoption histories.
