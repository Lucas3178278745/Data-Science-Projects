### **Abstract**  
We want to study the trend of video game development in recent decades. This is a worthwhile study because we can identify changes in the interests of young people throughout time. By revealing these information, we may be able to discover the impact of video games on the development of minors. Therefore, we intend to start our research with game sales data in recent decades.

### **Project Introduction**
In this era of high-speed information technology, video games have become an essential part of the daily life of the millennial generation, especially during the outbreak of COVID-19 in the past two years. The epidemic prevention policy has led to an exponential increase in the sales of video games. Our group wants to analyze the sales of video games in the past decades and thus have the ability to predict the future market of video games.

Since all three of us in the group have been exposed to many video games, we have all played various types of video games, which will be one of the primary motivations for this research. We have two major questions that we would like to use the skills of data visualization to come up with insights for answering. First, we want to know the comparison of the number of releases for each genre of the game from the first year of data availability to the last year, and, at the same time, we could also inspect how the release number of each particular genre of the game varies across years. Second, we would like to compare the sales of video games on each different platform. In this way, we could have a basic understanding of how the sales of video games vary from the past to nowadays by comparing the sales of the older generation of a platform (PS for example) and the sales of the younger generation (PS4 for example). If we can understand the trend of the variation of these variables, we can predict the future trend of video games, which will benefit the development of the video game market. In addition, analyzing these trends can also help game production groups and policymakers to realize potential problems that might be related to video games. 

### **Data Information**  
##### **Where did you find the data? Please include a link to the data source**  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales

##### **Who collected the data?**  
The data are being collected by VGChartz, which is a website containing collected sales data of a list of video games that greater than 100,000 copies.

##### **How was the data collected or generated?**  
The data were collected through the use of a python script based on BeautifulSoup. It collects the data based on the retail sampling and trends in each country. The data collected here would than be extrapolated to represent a wider region and thus leading them to end up with the data that would be ends up within 10% of the actual totals. When the official shipments figures were released by the officials (console manufacturers for example), they would update the data to bring them into line with those figures.

##### **Why was the data collected?**  
The data were being collected because they enable people to see the sales of video game and thus provide people insights into the gaming industry.

##### **How many observations (rows) are in your data?**  
There are total 16600 observations (rows) in the dataset.

##### **How many features (columns) are in the data?**  
There are total 11 features (columns) in the dataset.

##### **What, if any, ethical questions or questions of power do you need to consider when working with this data?**  
When working with this data, something that needs to be considered is that we should consider what kinds of laws or regulations would limit our data collection procedure and how would they impact the dataset that we chose. Whether the sales are under legislative control is one of the most important factors that we need to consider if we want to make our research in an ethical setting.

##### **What are possible limitations or problems with this data?**  
Each dataset has its own limitations that would impact the relevant study. Speaking of possible limitations of our chosen dataset, it is incomplete in different ways. First of all, when we sort the data by the publication years using descending order, we can find that there are lots of NA values, which are the value that is missing meaning, exists in our dataset. This would limit our potential research in finding the pattern of the trend of the most popular type of games in each decade. It would reduce the statistical power of our research and thus leading to potential false results. Another possible limitation that exists in our dataset is that the collection method can be varied with the time varied. Although the creator of the dataset used the same method (python script based on BeautifulSoup library) to collect each of the individual data and they control and predicted the total within 10% of the actual total, crossing a total of four decades, the method for each official to collect official data varied with the passage of time. Besides that, each console manufacturer may also have a different method of generating the actual sales. Therefore, we can say that the sales data in this dataset are not collected under the same circumstances which would potentially lead to various counting problems.

## **Implications**
By analyzing the popular games of each era, we can determine young people’s interest points and hobbies in different eras. We hope that the results of our analysis will answer some questions about gaming and the healthy development of young people. For example, are video games becoming more violent and vulgar? Are young people more interested in playing games that contain elements of pornography, gambling, and drugs? In addition, we can analyze the impact of video games on people over the decades. For example, we can find out if there is a direct relationship between games and youth crime. Of course, we may need more data sets and more analysis to answer this question.

## **Limitations & Challenges**  
One of the main problems we face now is that we don’t currently have enough data sets. If we want our conclusions to be more beneficial for policymaking, we may also need data on youth crime rates over time. We find a limitation in our current direction: analyzing sales of different game genres alone to determine young people’s preferences for video games does not tell us much. We should also investigate how crime rates among young people, especially those between the ages of 15 and 20, have changed in recent decades and what kinds of crimes are involved. Together with our research on changing preferences of young people for video game themes, we will be able to analyze how misleading games are for young people. Also, as mentioned above, our existing data contains many invalid data, which affects the validity of our results. In summary, we intend to collect additional data sets.
